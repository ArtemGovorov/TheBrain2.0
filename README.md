This is a repository for TheBrain 2.0 - The app that will make you remember everything forever.

We build this because of our passion to effective learning, and also as a showcase of how can you structure, code, and automate test/builds with the great modern tools of JS ecosystem.

We are using here:

react (create-react-app) - for web,
react-native (expo) - for ios/android,
express/apollo/graphql - for server

for testing web - jest with enzyme and cypress both with our custom "universal page objects pattern" (we will give you more info soon! very excited about this stuff)

for testing mobile - jest with enzyme and detox, again, with our custom "universal page objects pattern"

for testing server - jest

This is live at https://thebrain.pro, but also currently under a very heavy Work in Progress mode, please give us some time - we will be launching this early February 2018.
